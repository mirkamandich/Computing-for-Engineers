# Computing-for-Engineers

Using MATLAB software, we built our own virtual board game similar to Candyland.

The code begins by generating four player pieces and a path of squares; the size and order of which are randomized with each new game. Using functions, for loops, and while loops, the pieces moved along the path while also interacting with traps and bonuses. 

If a piece lands on a trap square, it will move the backward to a location determined by our trap function. Likewise, if a piece lands on a bonus, it will move forward a number of squares. The first piece to get to the last square wins.
